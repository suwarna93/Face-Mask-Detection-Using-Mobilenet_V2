# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Mobilenet_V2

### Motivation
In the rapid developing world, with increase in technology so is increasing diseases such as Covid-19.

To prevent the spread of disease it is absolutely compulsory to wear mask.

There is a need for Mask Detection technique as checking mask for every person by a person is not feasible, therefore we need a deep learning algorithm which will ease the work of human workforce.

###  Problem Statement

The goal is to predict whether the person is wearing a mask or not.

Since this is an issue of binary classification, the model if predicts correctly then a green rectangular box appears on person wearing mask.

If the person is not wearing mask, the model predicts red rectangular box on his face.

### Introduction

Face Mask detection has become a very trending application due to Covid-19 pandemic, which demands for a person to wear face masks, keep social distancing and use hand sanitizers to wash your hands.

While other problems of social distancing and sanitization have been addressed up till now, the problem of face mask detection has not been addressed yet.

This project proposes a model for face detection using OpenCV DNN, TensorFlow, Keras and MobileNetV2 architecture which is used as an image classifier.

This dataset could be used for developing new face mask detectors and performing several applications.

## About this Dataset

#### Context

The data is from: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades, included here for easy usage with OpenCV from Kaggle Kernels.
